# first-scraper
A web scraper built with Python to find public information and display into a CSV file.

Using the BeautifulSoup and requests toolsets, I was able to build a web scraper.

This tool is helpful when scanning information from a web page and return the information in a readable format.

This example uses a public government website that showcases inmate information at a prison. The program reads, writes, and outputs a readable file for the user.
